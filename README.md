# libtosa

This is an experiment to create a low-level tensor programing model around MLIR.TOSA

Experimentation is around:
1. Async Execution - can we abstract it?
2. Parallelization control - how developer can control parallel execution which is on an accelerator, not related to the CPU parallelism
3. Fusion, pipelining - how developer can enbale function futions and hetro-hw pipelining.

Share & Enjoy :smiley:
